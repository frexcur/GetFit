# GetFit
GetFit is a nutritional planner made in Java FX and that uses a Derby database to hold user information. Users will be able to set a profile picture, keep track of calories ate for each part of day, and get back the calories needed to hit their goals based on their personal information.

Like mentioned before it uses a Derby database to hold user information, but with future updates will also have a table added to the database to hold food information.

# Installation and running

To install and run is simple, just click on the AllFiles folder. You will unzip the GetLitGetFit2jar.zip. After that navigate to the GetLitGetFit2.jar and run it.

*Disclaimer*

Unfortunately only the profile, home, diary, and logout menu buttons work.
