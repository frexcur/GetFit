# GetFit
GetFit is a nutrional planner made in Java FX and that uses a Derby database to hold user information. Its still very much in alpha, but when near completition
will be able to track calories, set reminders on when to eat, etc.

# More to come
Like mentioned before it uses a Derby database to hold user information, but with future updates will also have a database to hold food information.
Once that is implemeneted you will be able to add your own food to the dabatase, and use it to look at the macros and add it to your food diary.
With that you can keep track of all the calories you're eating per day.

# Information
I got a lot of information from these websites.
